# F1-BI-Dashboards
This repository contains three Streamlit-based dashboards demonstrating how Business Informatics (BI) concepts can be applied to Formula 1 operations, from telemetry and component management to shipment logistics.

## Dashboards

### 1️. Telemetry Dashboard
Analyzes telemetry data to support real-time race decisions.  
📂 File: `Dashboard_code/Telemetry.py`

### 2️. Component Reliability Dashboard
Estimates component failure probabilities and cost trade-offs for replacement decisions.  
📂 File: `Dashboard_code/Component.py`

### 3️. Shipments Dashboard
Visualizes transport delays, costs, and logistics performance to support supply chain decisions.  
📂 File: `Dashboard_code/Shipments.py`

## Datasets
The following sample data are included in `/Data_samples`:
- `telemetry_30laps.txt`
- `components_example_data.txt`
- `shipments_example_data.txt`

These are small illustrative datasets generated by AI for the 'Business Informatics in Formula 1' analysis.

## Report
The full report detailing the Business Informatics analysis, methodology, dashboards, and insights is available here:

BI_in_F1_Final_Report

This report explains how the dashboards were designed, includes sample data, interactive analysis, and demonstrates how BI transforms raw data into actionable decisions in F1.

## -> How to Run
To launch any dashboard, first make sure you have the python file and the data txt file in the same folder, and then run:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib plotly numpy #These are the extensions needed to run the code
streamlit run <path to the desired Dashboard like Telemetry.py>
